# Project Checkpoint Report
[Project Page](https://joel99.github.io/parallel_final/)

In this checkpoint report, we will present our current progress on the term project as well as some new discoveries we have realized as we were working on our current implementations. We will also discuss potential updates in our project schedule in this report.

## Current Progress


- What we have learned
- What we have implemented
- Different implementational decisions
- Different levels of parallelism
- Discuss

In addition to providing a correct sequential implementation that correctly replicates most of the behaviors of the 

However, we also decided modify the overall directive of this project.

## Preliminary Testing Results

## Concerns and Unknowns
Our current progress mostly aligns with our initial expectations and it is likely that we will be able to complete all the "plan to achieve" deliverable items. However, due to the delays experienced in the project proposal phase, it is expected for us to perform most of the parallel program developmental work in the following two weeks.
