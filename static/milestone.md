## List of Concerns

## Updated Project Schedules
- 4/12:
  ðŸ”´ Provide a serial CPU C++ and pytorch (python with C++ bindings) implementation of the V1 algorithm. (Completed)
  ðŸ”µ Add naive OpenMP parallelism on guess and candidate loops. (In Progress)
  ðŸ”´ Provide test-bank evaluator and profile the two implementations on 5-letter wordle. (Completed)
- 4/15 (4/16 milestone report)
  ðŸ”µ Implement and profile guess level and candidate level parallelism while optimizing for memory locality and minimizing scatter reduce contention. (In Progress)
  âš« Evaluate correctness degradation with reduced synchronization on reduction. (Pending)
  ðŸ”µ Evaluate performance characteristics with multiple implementations of scatter reduce and map reduce (In Progress)
  âš« Implement message-passing solver with MPI (Pending)
- 4/22
  âš« Experiment with coloring matrix partitioning or on the fly coloring computation (all in OpenMP). (Pending)
  âš« Profile and optimize workload balancing across turns. (Pending)
  ðŸ”µ Scale problem size in number of letters (up to 7) (In Progress)
  âš« Implement and optimize GPU implementation of the wordle solver in CUDA (Pending)
- 4/29
  âš« Hope to Achieve: extend problem size in number of boards to solve. (Pending)
  âš« Perform problem size sensitivity analysis (Pending)
- 5/5  
  âš« Writing up report and preparing poster. (Pending)
