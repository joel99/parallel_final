# Project Checkpoint Report
[Project Page](https://joel99.github.io/parallel_final/)

In this checkpoint report, we will present our current progress on the term project as well as some new discoveries we have realized as we were working on our current implementations. We will also discuss potential updates in our project schedule in this report.

## Current Progress

We began working on this project after our revised proposals are completed, and we have successfully implemented a sequential solver that replicates the majority of the functionalities outlined in [_3Blue1Brown_'s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA). In addition to providing a fully functional sequential implementation, we have embedded automated testing and timing code into our program to facilitate performance evaluation in parallel implementations.

Our sequential algorithm roughly follows the routines underlined below: (Some edge cases and implementational details omitted) The game loop may be repeated multiple times to evaluate the performance of wordle solver on different words.
```
<Initialization Sequence: Set up word list and prior weights>
    Precompte the "pattern matrix" containing feedbacks for all guess-answer pairs
    # Game Loop Begins
    while <game not complete>:
        # Computation Phase
        for guess_word in <word list>:
            Pool the total weights from word priors for each coloring pattern via **scatter reduce**
            Compute guess_word's expected entropy I(g) by normalizing the pooled weights into a probability distribution.
            record guess_word's score as a function of its expected entropy.
        # Candidate Selection Phase
        candidate_word = argmax(scores)
        Obtain feedback by submitting candidate_word as guess
        # Solver Update Phase
        for word in <word list>:
            set word's prior weight to 0 if feedback(candidate_word, word) does not match.
        compute the sum of all prior weights to be used in the normalization step
    # Game Loop Ends
```

We have also carefully analysed our wordle solver algorithm, and two of the most important operations to be parallelized in our algorithm are **Map Reduce** and **Scatter Reduce**. The reduction algorithm is relatively straight forward to parallelise, and many parallel computing frameworks, such as OpenMP and MPI, provides primitives to efficiently perform reductions. However, the Scatter Reduce method is characterized by frequent memory access indirections and potential write contention in parallel implementations. We have currently proposed 3 potential implementations for parallel scatter reduce: a lock based approach, a reduction based approach and a reformulation of the scatter reduce problem as a sparse matrix vector multiplication problem. Since parallel **Map Reduce** and **Scatter Reduce** are key components of our wordle solver problem, we are interested in writing benchmarks for differen parallel implementations of these functions and include our findings in the final report.

As mentioned in the proposal document, during the computational phase, we could either parallelize over the "guess_word" dimension ("across-word parallelism"), which we believe is better suited for an MPI implementation, or implement "within-word parallelism" via parallel scatter reduce and reduction algorithm. Additionally, due to the high communication-to-computation ratio in our program, we are especially interested in running our algorithm on a GPU to take advantage of the higher mem

We have also decided modify the overall directive of this project. As mentioned in [_3Blue1Brown_'s addendum to the original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRed0Xmc2Wg), most of the algorithmic refinemenets included in his version 2 solver are aimed at reducing the average rounds required for a correct guess. However, since we are mostly interested in improving and measuring the parallel performance of the wordle solver on different machine architectures, it is likely that we will sideline the inclusion of some features of _3Blue1Brown_'s algorithm in our parallel implementations. In the "Updated Project Goals and Schedules" section, we have modified our objectives to reflect this change of project directive.

## Preliminary Testing Results
TODO

## Concerns and Unknowns
Our current progress mostly aligns with our initial expectations and it is likely that we will be able to complete all the "plan to achieve" deliverable items. However, due to the delays experienced in the project proposal phase, it is expected for us to perform most of the parallel program developmental work in the following two weeks.
